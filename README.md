# BlockRun: Made in high school
PLEASE NOTE: This was made in high school and before I realized code style and documentation were important. It's still a fun game though :).

This is a Geometry Dash-like game I made in high school. It additionally has a basic paint your own character feature, and you can then play with the character you designed.
